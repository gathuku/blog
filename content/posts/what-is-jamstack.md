## What is JAMstack  
JAM stands for JavaScript, API & Markup.

> A modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup

### JavaScript
Dynamic functionalities are handled by JavaScript. There is no restriction on which framework or library you must use

### APIs
Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third party services or your custom function

### Markup
Websites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator.

## Benefits
Here are some of the benefits
1. More secure
>No need to worry about server or database vulnerabilities

2. Less Expensive
>Hosting of static files are cheap or even free

3. Faster Performance
>Serve pre-built markup and assets over a CDN

4. Better Developer experience
>Front end developers can focus on the front end, without being tied to a monolithic architecture. This usually means quicker and more focused development.

5. Scalability
>If your product suddenly goes viral and has many active users, the CDN seamlessly compensates
